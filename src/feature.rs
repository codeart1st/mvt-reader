//! This module provides types and utilities for working with features in the `mvt-reader` crate.
//!
//! A feature represents a geographic entity with geometry and associated properties. Features are typically found within layers of a vector tile.
//!
//! # Types
//!
//! The `feature` module defines the following types:
//!
//! - `Feature`: Represents a feature with geometry and properties.
